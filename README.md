This repository contains sample CSS animations, different ways of enriching your projects with cool graphics, etc. Just my way of taking a break from intense programming! Exploring the fun side of CSS! Plus, the CSS animations keep getting sicker!

**CSS** - Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

**HTML** - The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

**ReactJS** - React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies.

**NodeJS** - Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on a JavaScript Engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, which was designed to build scalable network applications.

**Web Development** - Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.

**Front-End Development** - A front-end developer creates websites and applications using web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allow users to access and interact with the site or app.

**Back-End Development** -  Back-end development means working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you can't see on a website. Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end logic, application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers.

**Full-Stack Development** - Full stack development is the end-to-end development of applications. It includes both the front end and back end of an application.

### Advantages of CSS :
- Easier to maintain and update.
- Greater consistency in design.
- More formatting options.
- Lightweight code.
- Faster page speed.
- Quicker developer time.
